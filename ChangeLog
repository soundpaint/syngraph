	change listener methods.  Added change listener methods for newly
	introduced functions and sets.

	* src/core/de/uka/ipd/syngraph/DocumentInfo.java (new): Store and
	manage document meta information, such as the document's file
	path, its change status, the document author, and a reference to
	the document itself.

	has been replaced by the new DocumentInfo class.  Updated
	Copyright info.  Added support for sets and functions in MAP
	files.  Added public declarations for default colors and font.
	Replaced labelInfos by a set dedicated for key to symbol mapping
	for the NoticePad, which is defined in the MAP file.  Added
	support for more verbose error message when a MAP file is
	corrupted.  Bugfix: Made file format version error display an
	ordinary internationalized message; same for unknown properties.
	Changed MAP syntax "#" into "." for better consistency.  Implement
	load as in-place substitution, since document management is now
	performed by DocumentInfo.  Renamed "denounceAll" ->
	"detachFromGUI".  Renamed "announceAll" -> "attachToGUI".  Moved

	* src/core/de/uka/ipd/syngraph/ObjectTab.java: Bugfix: Do not
	crash if document is null.

	Document with that of DocumentInfo.

	GUI component layout: Add horizontal glue such that checkbox
	labels are put near to their corresponding checkboxes.

	* src/core/de/uka/ipd/syngraph/NoticeEditor.java: Added new
	cryptify option.  Renamed "content" -> "document".  Removed hooks
	"createNoticePane" and "createTextUpdater" for (now obsoleted)
	subclasses and made protected fields private.  Bugfix: Update not
	only colors, but also the font, if changed.  Bugfix: Do not crash
	if document is null.

	* src/core/de/uka/ipd/syngraph/MenuBar.java: Added "file->close".
	Replaced hard-coded "edit->copy ..." by soft-coded ones, generated
	from functions found in the MAP file.  Replaced dependency from
	Main with DocumentInfo.  Removed superfluous explicit call to
	super class.  Bugfix: disable "file->save" when file is unchanged.
	Disable "file->save", "file->saveAs", "file->close",
	"file->properties", "file->noticePad", and all "edit->*", when
	there is no document loaded.  Removed obsolete CrypticPad.

	* src/core/de/uka/ipd/syngraph/AppFrame.java: Replaced use of
	Document with that of DocumentInfo.  Pass only DocumentInfo to
	MenuBar rather than access to main class (but need to announce
	MenuBar as listener instead).  Bugfix: Need to make ToolBar
	listening to DocumentInfo change events.  Renamed method
	"log"->"logLine".  Bugfix: Need to care for visibility of status
	line.  Added method for clearing the status line.

	* src/core/de/uka/ipd/syngraph/ToolBar.java: Bugfix: Need to
	listen to change events in order to enable/disable save button.

	* src/core/de/uka/ipd/syngraph/ColorChooser.java,
	src/core/de/uka/ipd/syngraph/PropertiesDialog.java: Removed
	obsolete change listeners.  Added change listeners for newly
	introduced functions and sets.

	* src/core/de/uka/ipd/syngraph/PrintDialog.java: Commented out
	book printing stuff, since only a single page is printed.

	* src/core/de/uka/ipd/syngraph/Main.java: Replaced use of Document
	with or added to it that of DocumentInfo.  Bumped program version
	to 0.2.  Bumped file format version to 0.2.  Minor fix in
	capitalization of property key.

	* src/core/de/uka/ipd/syngraph/GUI.java: Removed support for
	CrypticEditor.  Added support for new item "file->close".
	Replaced dedicated copy menu items in "edit" menu by a variable
	number of generic copy menu items, as defined in the MAP file.
	Bugfix: Consistently pass owner parent frame to dialogs.  Replaced
	use of Document with that of DocumentInfo.  Tremendously
	simplified the code for exiting the application by using the new
	document close functionality.

	* src/core/de/uka/ipd/syngraph/Resources_en.properties,
	src/core/de/uka/ipd/syngraph/Resources_de.properties,
	src/core/de/uka/ipd/syngraph/Resources.java: Added I18N labels for
	new cryptify option in NoticePad dialog and for new menu item
	"file->close".  Removed obsoleted CrypticPad labels.  Replaced
	copy menu item labels by a generic label.  Added labels for more
	detailed messages on corrupted MAP files.  Updated Copyright and
	download link.  Minor fixes in translations and capitalization of
	property keys.

	* src/core/de/uka/ipd/syngraph/FontDialog.java: Replace buttons
	Cancel/Apply/Close by Cancel/Approve.  This change solves the
	problem of cancelling a previously performed apply.

	* src/core/de/uka/ipd/syngraph/Main.java: Removed obsolete
	debugging code.

	* src/media/MAP: Bumped file format version to 0.2.  Changed
	syntax "#"->"." where appropriate.  Added object sets for copy
	functions.  Make more pervasive use of unicode characters in
	labels and comments (musical flat symbol, left/right quotes,
	etc.).

	* TODO: Added feature request: copy function mnemonics support.
	Added feature requests for documentation dialog.  Added feature
	request: non-character object selection for insertion.  Added
	Document.ObjectSet I18N bug.  Added note on NullPointerException
	in PrintDialog.  Removed solved issues.

	* src/core/de/uka/ipd/syngraph/CrypticEditor.java: Removed, since
	NoticeEditor now supports encryption.

	directory.

	* build.xml: Added code to create help documentation, web
	documentation and java documentation separately.  Build help
	documentation and web documentation from same sources.  Fine-tuned
	order of jar file entries.  Put javadoc into zip file rather than
	jar file.  Removed obsolete commented-out code.
