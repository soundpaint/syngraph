    <h1>SynGraph</h1>
    <p>
      <b><font color="#ff0000">S</font>yn<font
      color="#660000">G</font><font color="#00cc33">r</font><font
      color="#000066">a</font><font color="#009999">p</font><font
      color="#f8faae">h</font></b> is a software tool for capturing
      and visualizing data on object-color mappings in the field of
      graphemic synaesthesia.  object-color mappings can be
      interactively entered into the software through its graphical
      user interface; the resulting diagrams can be viewed on screen,
      printed to paper as well as permanently stored on disk.
    </p>
    <h2>Basic Properties of the Software</h2>
    <p>
      As of its current version 0.2, the software supports the
      following basic functionality:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>
	<b>Data Capturing</b>
      </dt>
      <dd>
	Capturing object-color mappings can be interactively performed
	on screen with mouse and keyboard input by choosing an
	individual color for each object in a diagram.  Objects are
	represented by character strings, including single letters and
	digits.  Captured data is stored in a simple, XML based file.
	This file and any other associated resources are compressed
	and saved in an archive, following the .zip file format.
	Having collected graphemic data from multiple people, the
	simple file format makes it easy to further process the data
	for analytical studies.  For example, external additional
	tools could be applied in order to automatically compute a
	statistic evaluation of the object-color mappings of a larger
	number of probationers, in order to reveal similarities and
	differences in their individual mappings.  A typical result
	could be the finding that people who perceive the letter
	<tt>A</tt> in red color, tend to perceive the letter
	<tt>I</tt> in yellow or white color.
      </dd>
      <dt>
	<b>
	  Comparing Representation of Selected Criteria of Order
	</b>
      </dt>
      <dd>
	The program also enables the user to graphically verify
	hypothetical inclinations of mappings.  To achieve this goal,
	the program groups objects in tabbed panes, placed according
	to specific similarity criteria (cp. Fig. 1), for example by
	ordering capital letters and digits by their geometrical form,
	assuming a classical sans serif font for the notion of
	geometrical form of characters.  Further criteria for ordering
	are imaginable, such as phonetic similarity of words or
	letters, similarity of muscles activated upon speaking
	(anatomic similarity), sorting of letters according to the
	order pupils learn them in school, or sorting of letters
	according to their frequency in natural language.  The tabbed
	panes enable the user to directly visually compare and value
	such orderings and their correspondence to their individual
	object-color mappings.  Moreover, by comparing the diagrams in
	the tabbed pane, the probationer can immediately recognize how
	far pure reordering of characters influences the colored
	perception of objects.

	  </tr>
	</table>
      </dd>
      <dt>
	<b>Personally Colored Note Pad</b>
      </dt>
      <dd>
	The coloured notepad displays arbitrary texts according to the
	object-color mapping of characters.  The text can be manually
	entered or cut-&amp;-pasted into the pad, displayed, printed,
	or saved as image.  This way, the characteristics of an
	individual person's graphemic synaesthesia can be nicely
	illustrated as well as used for validation of the user's
	specification of character-color mapping.

	  </tr>
	</table>
      </dd>
      <dt>
	<b>Miscelleanous Properties</b>
      </dt>
      <dd>
	The software also supports selecting the font and character
	size to be used for display, as well as the background color
	(cp. Fig. 3).  Committing a change of such a property in one
	window immediately affects display in all other simultaneously
	opened windows.

	</table>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <h2>Current Limitations</h2>
    <p>
      Currently, the software supports only few forms of synaesthesia
      reaching beyond pure character-color mappings.  Mappings from
      character strings to colors are partially supported.  The set of
      missing features most notably contains multi-colored or textured
      objects; consideration of contextual influence of neighbouring
      colored objects (e.g. colored letters within a word); and
      objects beyond characters and strings.  The supported set of
      colors currently is based on the standard RGB color model;
      transparent or metallic colors are not supported by now.
    </p>
    <h2>Advanced Description</h2>
    <p>
      A more detailed description of the software is currently not
      available.  Still, most of the features built into the software
      should be self-explanatory.  <i>In case, somebody writes a more
      comprehensive documentation in an appropriate style, I will
      gladfully insert the documentation in this place.</i>
