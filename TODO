           "transparent" or "metallic")

           * most recently used files
           * path settings (if any)

       answer
* BUG: I18N resources: Fix inconsistent punctuation and capitalization.
* BUG: ProportionalLayout: autoScale/autoOffset does not work
       correctly
* BUG: Some mnemonics (keyboard shortcuts) collide.
* BUG: missing mnemonics (keyboard shortcuts) in font and file dialog
* BUG: do not use different JOptionPane styles (internal vs. default
       dialog)
* FEATURE: add toggle item such that whenever a color is assigned to a
           letter, it is assigned to both, the lower case and the
           upper case
* FEATURE: support transparent colors (with background pattern or
           animation)
* FEATURE: support multicolors
* FEATURE: support background images/textures for making transparent
           colors better showing off
* FEATURE: support undo
* FEATURE: Global Properties: contact address (email) or ID for
           researchers that would like to ask something e.g. in order
           to clarify a comment.
* BUG: inconsistent naming "comment" vs. "description"
* BUG: Sometimes, JOptionPane dialogs pop up that resize to the root
       window size (a JDK bug?).
* FEATURE: DocumentationDialog: Add navigation history ("back" /
           "forward" buttons), search function, index, etc.  Mark
           external links.  Invoke browser application upon click on
           external links.  Should use "Java Help" package, as soon as
           it officially becomes part of the JRE.
* FEATURE: NoticeEditor: To allow the user choosing between ambigous
           objects with identical label, add a context menu to
           NoticePane that let's the user optionally select the
           desired object from a list of object descriptions for all
           objects with this label.
* BUG: Document.ObjectSet does not correctly handle I18N; it works
       only for the locale that was active when the document was
       loaded.  Example for a locale/label mismatch: For locale
       "en_US", there is a musical key B which is labelled "H" in
       locale "de".
* BUG: PrintDialog crashes with NullPointerException.  Most probably a
       bug in the interaction between the JDK and CUPS printing
       service, see e.g.:
       http://forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=553362&tstart=0
* BUG: Object context menu dialog "change comment" is broken.
* FEATURE: Create self-extracting/self-installing windows EXE binary.
           Candidate third-party helpers for this task are Launch4J
           and VAInstall (see
           http://java-source.net/open-source/installer-generators for
           a more complete list of installer generators).  Maybe NSIS
           (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) or Microsoft's WiX or
           MSI SDK are also helpful.
